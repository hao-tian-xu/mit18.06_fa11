## Linear Algebra

This repository shares the learning process of course 18.06 with online materials from MIT OCW. The results are divided into the following two parts:

1. Lecture notes (in Markdown)
   - Including a final review (only in Chinese now), which borrows some insight from Prof. Gilbert Strang's new course *[A 2020 Vision of Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-18-010-a-2020-vision-of-linear-algebra-spring-2020/)*.
   - Including notes taken from 3Blue1Brown's online series *[Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)*, which provides a geometric intuition.
2. Exams' hand-written solutions
   - They may be converted to Markdown in the future.
